Hello, and welcome to Heroes; 
This is a match card type of game, where you got 20 cards with every 2 of them being the same. 
The game is simple, you have 100 sec to finish the game or you will lose. 
For me being a games fanatic, and also i like the DOTA game, i decided to create a match card game including characters from that particular game.

This a single page game, which has html, CSS and javascript.The HTML file has a title, a game container and a game-info all displayed on one page.
The CSS contains all of the styling for the HTML elements, also has that flipcard logic where we chose a class from another in order to give it the flipcard animations, also has the overlay click to start animations and other styles. 
The Javascript has the audio class, where we got all the audio for the game, like start background music, victory music, the flip card audio and many other. 
In there we also have the flip card functions, match the cards.
